# Maven-Market
A Power BI project - 

"Maven Market" Analytics is based on a hackathon our team participated in, where we were tasked with formulating suggestions and recommendations, in order to assist an imaginary FMCG firm that sold products across three North American countries - the USA, Canada, and México.
Tasks included:

• Prepping up a topline summary of sales, transactions and returns, temporally.

• Analyzing the customer base, by various demographic attributes - education, location, income et cetera.

• Focus on specific products, which had 1,560 categories and had to be dissected by locations and assessed revenue-wise.

• Providing additional recommendations and suggestions, to boost profit margins, transactions, and revenues, overall.
